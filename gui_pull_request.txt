== ISSUES WITH GUI TO RESOLVE IN A PULL REQUEST ==

Container issues
- crashes when empty - needs conditions at the beginning of OnMouseDown, OnMouseUp, OnKeyDown, OnKeyPress
- crashes when multiple containers exist - fixed by same as above

GuiElement issues
- OnMouseUpOnElement - does not set args.Handled = true (unlike OnMouseDownOnElement, which does) - this means text inputs in containers instantly lose focus, because
the container thinks the mouse up happened somewhere outside the bounds/on no element at all

GuiElementTextInput
- uses GlScissors instead of api.PushScissors and api.PopScissors - this means it breaks scrollable areas and shows outside of them

newly add: GuiElementScrollableArea
- having a simple way to make an area with a scrollbar and a container is incredibly useful
- option to only have the scrollbar show up when content bounds are bigger than clipping bounds, ie when there is something to scroll to? Scrollbar is pointless otherwise
- ask Fulgen for permission
